name: export-conversation-notes
description: Export the currently available Codex/chat session record into a target Markdown file, defaulting to human_notes/. Save only user inputs and Codex final outputs. Use when the user asks to save, archive, output, or record the current conversation, dialogue history, or analysis session in the paper_analysis workspace. If the target Markdown file already exists and is non-empty, append incrementally without modifying, deleting, reformatting, or replacing any existing content.

# Export Conversation Notes

## Overview

Save the current session's available user inputs and Codex final outputs to the requested target location. Default to `human_notes/` when no explicit directory is provided. Default to Chinese for headings and status text. Do not save process notes, status updates, tool calls, command outputs, hidden instructions, or intermediate work logs.

## Workflow

1. Identify the target path.
   - save under `human_notes/`.
   - If no filename can be identified, use `<session-name>.md` and <session-name> is the name of the current session.

2. Prepare the target file.
   - Work relative to the current workspace root.
   - Ensure the destination directory exists.
   - Sanitize only the filename portion by replacing filesystem-hostile characters such as `/`, `\`, `:`, `*`, `?`, `"`, `<`, `>`, and `|` with safe separators, then trim whitespace.
   - Save to the resolved target path.

3. Capture the available conversation record.
   - Output only user inputs and Codex final outputs in chronological order with speaker labels.
   - Include all available user messages exactly as written.
   - Include only Codex final responses that answer the user, not interim progress updates or tool-facing content.
   - Do not include tool calls, shell commands, command outputs, file edit logs, errors from tools, status updates, planning chatter, hidden system/developer/policy/runtime instructions, or intermediate reasoning.
   - Do not summarize, compress, paraphrase, normalize, or reorganize the saved user inputs and final outputs.
   - If earlier user inputs or final outputs are unavailable because context was compacted or not exposed to Codex, state this limitation briefly before the saved conversation.

4. Write the Markdown file.
   - If the file does not exist, create it with the new-file template.
   - If the file exists but is empty, write the new-file template.
   - If the file exists and is non-empty, enter incremental mode: append a new dated section only at the end of the file.
   - In incremental mode, never modify, delete, reorder, summarize, normalize, reformat, or replace any existing content, even if the existing note has typos, duplicate headings, stale metadata, or inconsistent formatting.
   - In incremental mode, use an append-only edit. With `apply_patch`, add only new lines after the existing final line.
   - Keep the saved record readable, but preserve the available user inputs and final outputs over brevity.
   - If the record is too long for one edit, append it in multiple consecutive chunks until all currently available user inputs and final outputs are saved.

## Markdown Template

For a new file, use this structure:

```md
# <session-or-paper-title>

- 导出时间：<YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ>
- 来源：当前 Codex session 可用对话上下文
- 保存路径：<resolved-target-path>
- 范围：仅用户输入与 Codex 最终输出

## 对话记录

### 001 User
<用户消息原文>

### 002 Codex Final
<Codex 最终回复原文>
```

For appending to an existing non-empty file, add this block at the end of the file without changing earlier content:

```md
---

## 对话记录补充：<YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM TZ>

<continue the same chronological format, saving only user inputs and Codex final outputs>
```

## Completion Response

After saving, respond briefly with the output path and whether the file was created or appended. Mention any uncertainty about target inference or incomplete available conversation context.
